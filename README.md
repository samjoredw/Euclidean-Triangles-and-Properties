## Triangles Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Triangles Project! This project explores the characteristics and properties of triangles. As my first programming project, I've implemented a simple program in Java to create triangles, calculate their properties, and assess their relationships. This README.txt file provides an overview of the project, instructions for usage, and additional information.

## Project Overview
The Triangles project is designed to:

1. Create triangles based on user input for side lengths.
2. Calculate and display various properties of each triangle.
3. Test the equality of perimeters between different triangles.

The project consists of two main classes:

1. **Triangle.java**: Defines the properties and behaviors of a triangle, such as calculating perimeter, checking types of triangles, and determining validity.

2. **TriangleDemo.java**: Demonstrates the use of the Triangle class by creating triangles, assessing their properties, and testing perimeter equality.

## Usage
To run my Euclidean-Triangles-and-Properties Project, follow these steps...

Open up a terminal window and run the following commands: 

    git clone https://github.com/samjoredw/Euclidean-Triangles-and-Properties.git
    cd Euclidean-Triangles-and-Properties/src
    javac triangles/Triangle.java triangles/TriangleDemo.java
    java triangles.TriangleDemo
